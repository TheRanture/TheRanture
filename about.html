  <h2>About us</h2>
<p>Fuck that! There is no "us", this isn't a conservative corporate bullshitboard.</p>

<p>I'm K.R. Hayden, aka Count Rantula. This platform is for me to rant, and I redefine ranting as something positive and valuable.  
While everyone is busy consuming, pretending, and worshiping celebrities, you chose to give the rants a chance to be heard, which is a huge step in a modern, backwards, hypocritical society.</p>

<p>Here, I'll be posting articles and rants on a wide range of topics, sometimes with the help of AI language models that act as my editor and advisor.  
Instead of using AI to generate slop and nonsense and 6 fingered humans, I use it for grammar checks and refinement of my writing.  
If you don't yet see a problem with the current world order, I'd suggest you take a good look: Do we, as citizens, have any control over the world?  
How about over our continent? Our country? Our city? Our town? Our own neighborhood?  
Yeah, this is multi-layered slavery that buries people in tightly compressed strata of problems and distractions, so you have neither a free moment nor the energy left to care about the rules that govern you and your country! rules that directly affect your life.</p>

  <h2>About Ranture</h2>
<p>I'm K.R. Hayden, aka Count Rantula.</p>

<p>This platform contains commentary by me on different topics; there may be humor, there may be seriousness, but in the end, it's an effort to keep the balance.</p>

<p>I use AI tools for technical help with the website and editorial help with my writings. I create and write my own material, and I read what I write at-least a coulpe of times. 
In my opinion, if someone hasn't bothered to write it, you shouldn't bother to read it.</p>
